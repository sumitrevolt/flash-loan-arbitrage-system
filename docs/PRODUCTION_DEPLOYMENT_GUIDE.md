# üöÄ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Update `.env` file with your production settings:
  ```bash
  PRIVATE_KEY=your_actual_private_key_here
  WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address_here
  POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key_here
  POLYGON_RPC_URL=your_preferred_polygon_rpc_url
  ```

### 2. Wallet Requirements
- [ ] Ensure wallet has at least **0.5 MATIC** for deployment and setup
- [ ] Verify wallet has sufficient MATIC for ongoing transactions
- [ ] Backup your private key securely

### 3. API Keys
- [ ] Get PolygonScan API key from https://polygonscan.com/apis
- [ ] Consider premium RPC endpoints for better reliability

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Compile and Test
```bash
# Clean and compile
npm run clean
npm run compile

# Run tests (optional but recommended)
npx hardhat test test/FlashLoanArbitrageFixed.simple.test.js
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Polygon Mainnet
```bash
# Standard deployment
npm run deploy

# OR AI-powered deployment with advanced features
npm run deploy:ai
```

### Step 3: Verify Contract
```bash
# Verify on PolygonScan (wait 2-3 minutes after deployment)
npm run verify

# OR manually with contract address
npx hardhat run scripts/verify.js --network polygon <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### Step 4: Setup and Configuration
```bash
# Standard setup (whitelist tokens, approve DEXes)
npm run setup

# OR MCP-powered setup with AI optimization
npm run setup:mcp
```

### Step 5: Health Check
```bash
# Monitor contract health
npm run health-check
```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Contract Verification
- [ ] Verify contract source code on PolygonScan
- [ ] Check that all functions are accessible
- [ ] Verify token whitelist and DEX approvals

### 2. Security Review
- [ ] Confirm contract ownership
- [ ] Test pause/unpause functionality
- [ ] Verify emergency withdrawal works
- [ ] Check slippage tolerance settings

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up contract monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerts for failed transactions
- [ ] Monitor gas usage and optimization

### 4. Production Configuration
- [ ] Set appropriate slippage tolerance (3-5%)
- [ ] Configure fee parameters
- [ ] Set up fee recipient address
- [ ] Enable/disable features as needed

## Important Security Notes

### üîê Private Key Security
- **NEVER** commit private keys to version control
- Use hardware wallets for production deployments
- Consider multi-sig wallets for additional security

### üõ°Ô∏è Contract Security
- The contract includes several safety features:
  - Reentrancy protection
  - Pausable functionality  
  - Circuit breaker for failed transactions
  - Owner-only administrative functions

### üö® Emergency Procedures
- **Pause Contract**: `contract.pause()` (owner only)
- **Emergency Withdrawal**: Available when paused
- **Update Parameters**: Slippage, fees, etc. (owner only)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Regular health checks
npm run health-check

# Check specific metrics
npx hardhat console --network polygon
> const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("FlashLoanArbitrageFixed", "YOUR_ADDRESS")
> await contract.getHealthStatus()
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor gas usage per transaction
- Track successful vs failed arbitrage attempts
- Observe profit margins and fee collection
- Monitor DEX liquidity and price differences

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular health checks
- Update whitelisted tokens as needed
- Adjust slippage tolerance based on market conditions
- Monitor and respond to failed transaction patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Deployment Fails**: Check MATIC balance and gas prices
2. **Verification Fails**: Wait longer after deployment, check API key
3. **Setup Fails**: Ensure you're the contract owner
4. **Health Check Fails**: Check network connection and contract address

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test with Small Amounts**: Start with minimal arbitrage amounts
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track success rates and profitability
3. **Optimize Parameters**: Adjust settings based on performance data
4. **Scale Gradually**: Increase transaction sizes as confidence grows
5. **Community Integration**: Consider integrating with DEX aggregators

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This is a complex DeFi system. Always test thoroughly and start with small amounts in production!
