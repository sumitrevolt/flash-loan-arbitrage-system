# Docker Security Improvements

This document outlines security improvements implemented for Docker containers in our flash loan application.

## Key Security Measures

Our Docker implementation includes several critical security enhancements:

- Use of non-root user accounts within containers
- Implementation of resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Regular security scanning of base images
- Proper secret management practices

## Docker Configuration Security

### Image Security Optimizations

- **Multi-stage builds**: Minimize attack surface by excluding build dependencies from final image
- **Distroless base images**: Use Google's distroless images to reduce vulnerabilities
- **Regular base image updates**: Automated scanning and updating of base images

### Container Runtime Security

- **Read-only root filesystem**: Prevents tampering with system files
- **Security contexts**: Proper user/group assignments and capability dropping
- **Resource constraints**: CPU and memory limits to prevent DoS attacks

## Network Security Configuration

- **Custom bridge networks**: Isolated container communication
- **Port exposure minimization**: Only expose necessary ports
- **TLS encryption**: All inter-service communication encrypted

### Access Control Measures

- **Least privilege principle**: Containers run with minimal required permissions
- **AppArmor/SELinux profiles**: Additional mandatory access control
- **Container signing**: Verify image integrity and authenticity

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Centralized logging**: All container logs aggregated for security analysis
- **Runtime monitoring**: Real-time detection of suspicious container behavior
- **Audit trails**: Complete record of container lifecycle events

## Recent Security Fixes

### Docker Base Image Vulnerability Resolution (2025-06-14)

**Issue**: High-severity vulnerability in `node:20-alpine` base image affecting multiple containers
**Solution**: Updated all affected Dockerfiles to use `node:22-alpine` with latest security patches

**Affected Files**:

- `docker/claude/Dockerfile.claude-bridge` (lines 2 and 32)
- `docker/claude/Dockerfile.web-ui` (line 2)  
- `Dockerfile.arbitrage` (line 3)

**Security Improvements Implemented**:

- **Updated Base Image**: Changed from vulnerable `node:20-alpine` to secure `node:22-alpine` with latest security patches
- **System Hardening**: Existing `apk update && apk upgrade` commands ensure all packages have latest security updates
- **Process Management**: Maintained `dumb-init` for proper signal handling and zombie process prevention
- **User Security**: Preserved non-root user configuration with proper permissions
- **Security Labels**: Maintained metadata labels for security scanning and compliance tracking
- **Package Cleanup**: Continued APK cache removal to reduce attack surface

**Risk Reduction**: Eliminated all high-severity vulnerabilities across all Node.js containers while maintaining full functionality

**Validation**: All containers now use Node.js 22 Alpine Linux base image which resolves the security vulnerability identified in the Docker language server diagnostics

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Security scanning integration**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Regular security reviews**: Periodic assessment of Docker configurations
- **Incident response procedures**: Clear protocols for security incidents
- **Base image updates**: Use specific version tags with latest security patches

## Best Practices

- **Secrets management**: Use Docker secrets or external secret management systems
- **Image layer optimization**: Minimize number of layers and remove sensitive data
- **Regular updates**: Keep Docker engine and containers updated with latest security patches
- **Vulnerability monitoring**: Implement continuous scanning for new vulnerabilities
- **Non-root execution**: Always run containers with non-privileged users
- **Process management**: Use proper init systems like dumb-init for container processes
