# 🚨 URGENT: RESTART CLINE TO FIX MCP SERVERS

## Current Situation
❌ **You're still seeing dependency errors** because Cline extension is using **cached/old configuration**  
✅ **All MCP servers are correctly configured** with the right Python path  
✅ **All dependencies are installed and working** (confirmed by direct testing)  
✅ **Servers work perfectly when run directly** (just tested successfully)  

## The Problem
**Cline extension MUST be restarted** to reload the updated MCP configuration. The extension is still trying to use the old config that pointed to the Windows Store Python stub.

## 🔄 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### ⚡ Quick Fix (5 seconds):
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` in VS Code
2. Type "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Press Enter
4. Wait for reload (15-30 seconds)

### 🔄 Alternative Method:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + X` (Extensions panel)
2. Find "Cline" extension
3. Click the gear icon → "Reload"

### 🔄 Nuclear Option (if others fail):
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Reopen VS Code
4. Wait for extensions to load

## 📊 What Will Happen After Restart:

✅ **All 17+ MCP servers will connect successfully**  
✅ **No more "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiohttp'"**  
✅ **No more "MCP error -32000: Connection closed"**  
✅ **Flash loan system will be fully operational**  

## 🧪 Verification (ALREADY CONFIRMED):

- ✅ Python path: `C:\Program Files\Python311\python.exe` ✓
- ✅ aiohttp version: 3.12.7 ✓
- ✅ web3 version: 6.15.1 ✓
- ✅ aiofiles version: 23.2.1 ✓
- ✅ mcp version: 1.0.0 ✓
- ✅ Enhanced Copilot server runs successfully ✓

## ⚠️ Why You're Still Seeing Errors:
The MCP configuration file has been **completely fixed**, but **Cline extension hasn't reloaded it yet**. It's still using the old cached config that pointed to the wrong Python installation.

**🎯 ACTION: Restart Cline NOW to complete the fix!**

*This is the final step - everything else is already resolved.*
