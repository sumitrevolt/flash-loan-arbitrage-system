2. Add `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_key_here` to your `.env` file
3. Run the verification script: `python verify_contract_polygonscan.py`

## Verification Status Check

After verification, you can:
1. Check the contract page: https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb5855560f3558844dCC5856BDa33D2fb7BD4B04F#code
2. Verify that the "Contract" tab shows the source code
