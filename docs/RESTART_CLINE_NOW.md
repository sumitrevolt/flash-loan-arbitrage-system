# ðŸš¨ MCP Server Restart Required

## Current Status
âœ… **All MCP servers are properly configured** with the correct Python path:
```
"command": "C:\\Program Files\\Python311\\python.exe"
```

âœ… **Dependencies are available** - all required packages (aiohttp, web3, aiofiles, mcp) are installed in the main Python installation.

âœ… **Servers work correctly** - manual testing confirms servers start without dependency errors.

## The Issue
The `flash_loan_enhanced_copilot` server (and others) are still showing dependency errors because **Cline/Claude Dev extension is using the old configuration** that pointed to the Windows Store Python stub.

## âš¡ SOLUTION: Restart Cline Extension

**You MUST restart the Cline/Claude Dev extension** for it to reload the updated MCP configuration.

### Method 1: Reload VS Code Window (Recommended)
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` in VS Code
2. Type "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Press Enter
4. Wait for VS Code to reload

### Method 2: Restart Extension Only
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + X` to open Extensions
2. Find "Cline" extension
3. Click "Reload" or disable/enable it

### Method 3: Complete VS Code Restart
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Reopen VS Code
3. Extension will reload with new configuration

## Expected Result After Restart
âœ… All MCP servers should connect successfully  
âœ… No more "ModuleNotFoundError" messages  
âœ… No more "Connection closed" errors  
âœ… All 17+ servers should show as connected

**Status**: âœ… Configuration fixed - **RESTART REQUIRED** to complete the fix
